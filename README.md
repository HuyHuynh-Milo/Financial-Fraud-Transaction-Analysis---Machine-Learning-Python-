## üìÉ Background & Overview:

‚úÖ **Objective:**

This project is designed to analyze and predict fraudulent financial transactions with the goal of enhancing fraud detection and prevention. The objectives include:
- **Feature engineering & analysis**: Develop meaningful features from raw transaction data to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Identify fraud patterns**: Explore large-scale transaction data to uncover hidden trends and behavioral patterns associated with fraudulent activity.
- **Support investigation & prevention**: Provide insights that can assist organizations in detecting suspicious activity earlier, reducing financial losses, and strengthening risk management strategies.
- **Build predictive models**: Apply machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, and evaluate their performance.
- **Scalability & adaptability**: Ensure the solution can be applied to different datasets and adapted to evolving fraud techniques.

üî≠ **Scope:**

The scope of this project defines the boundaries and focus areas for fraud detection and prediction:
- Data exploration & preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw financial transaction data for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding transaction patterns, fraud distribution, and correlations among features.
- Model development & evaluation: Building and testing machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to detect fraud.
- Performance measurement: Using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model effectiveness.
- Practical application: Providing insights and predictive tools that can support fraud investigators and risk management teams.
Out of scope: This project does not cover deployment into production systems, integration with real-time transaction monitoring platforms, or regulatory/legal aspects of fraud management.

## üìÇ Dataset description & structure
üìé **Data Source:**
- The dataset for this project is in the csv file name "mini-project2" attached to this repository
- Size: 1 dataframe contains 22 features and nearly 100,000 observations

üìå **Data Description:**

- The dataset contains detailed information about financial transactions, including customer demographics, merchant details, and fraud labels. Each row represents a single transaction with the following attributes:
